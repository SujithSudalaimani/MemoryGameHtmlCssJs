This is a simple Memory Card Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to play:
Click on a card to flip it and reveal the image.

Flip another card and try to find a match.

If both cards have the same image, they stay flipped.

If the images do not match, the cards will flip back after a short delay.

Use the Restart button to reset the game with shuffled cards.
